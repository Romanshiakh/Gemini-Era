            <h2>FASHION DESIGNERS</h2>
            <p>Style is a way to say who you are without having to speak. Style is the only thing you can’t buy. It’s
                not in a shopping bag, a label, or a price tag. It’s something reflected
                from our soul to the outside world—an emotion."The zenith of elegance in any woman's wardrobe is the
                little black dress, the power of which suggests dash and
                refinement."— Andre Leon Talley

                "Give a girl the right kind of shoes and she can rule the world." — Marilyn Monroe

                "Gather up your courage like an armful of free clothes at a McQueen sample sale and follow your inner
                voice wherever it
                takes you." – Kelly Cutrone
                "Florals? For Spring? Groundbreaking." – Miranda Priestly
                "Clothes aren't going to change the world. The women who wear them are." – Anne Klein

                "If you love something, wear it all the time. Find things that suit you. This is how you look
                extraordinary." – Vivienne
                Westwood
                "Fashion as we knew it is over; people wear now exactly what they feel like wearing." – Mary Quant
                "One should always dress like a marble column."– Jackie Kennedy
                "Style is knowing what suits you, who you are, and what your assets are. It's excepting it all." –
                Bianca Jagger</p>

            <p>"My commitment is to make a strong and modern collection without compromising my ethics and key values,
                taking into
                consideration where materials come from and who is making them—luxury with a conscience, or in other
                words, honest
                luxury." —Gabriela Hearst

                "We all have those go-to pieces in our closet that we keep for years and literally wear out before we
                retire them. I'm
                here to make the go-tos, the keepers." —Jamie Okuma

                "I don't like to produce things in a factory. It seems stressful. If I produce stuff, I have to work
                with a small team.
                I don't like working with a lot of people. I like the freedom of being creative."</p>

            <h5>"Fashion is about dressing according to what’s fashionable. Style is more about being yourself." —Oscar
                de la Renta

                "Girls do not dress for boys. They dress for themselves, and of course, each other. If girls dressed for
                boys, they’d
                just walk around naked at all times.” —Betsey Johnson

                "The joy of dressing is an art." —John Galliano</h5>

            <p>"As a woman gets older, it's more about style than fashion. A woman knowing herself more and more, and
                looking for new
                things, is getting into her own personal style, being more than just a fashion addict. I'm interested in
                that." —Nicolas
                Ghesquière

                "I think fashion can do a lot. Fashion is very popular, so it can help broadcast a message and reach a
                new generation."
                —Maria Grazia ChiuriI think the fashion is super serious and humor is suspect and people don't always
                know how to approach it. Sometimes
                people have questioned whether I was making fun of the industry or just at myself. I'm just trying to
                raise a smile.
                Clothes aren't meant to be worshipped at a church altar. I have a different approach to most designers.
